# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves restructuring and enhancing the pet adoption system to properly organize backend functionality, improve admin and shelter management interfaces, and establish proper Supabase integration. The system supports three user roles: regular users (who can adopt pets), shelter admins (who can manage animals), and system admins (who can manage shelters). The goal is to create a cohesive, well-structured application that matches the current theme and provides role-based functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system admin, I want to manage shelters through a properly themed admin interface, so that I can add new shelters and oversee the entire adoption system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the admin page THEN the system SHALL display a themed interface matching the current application design
2. WHEN an admin wants to add a new shelter THEN the system SHALL provide a form to create shelters with name, location, and contact information
3. WHEN an admin views the shelter list THEN the system SHALL display all registered shelters with their details
4. WHEN an admin attempts to add animals directly THEN the system SHALL prevent this action and display appropriate messaging
5. IF an admin is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a shelter admin, I want to manage animals through a properly themed shelter interface, so that I can add rescued animals for adoption while being restricted from creating new shelters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a shelter admin accesses the shelter page THEN the system SHALL display a themed interface matching the current application design
2. WHEN a shelter admin wants to add a new animal THEN the system SHALL provide a form to create animals with all required details and automatically link them to their shelter via shelter_id
3. WHEN a shelter admin views their animals THEN the system SHALL display only animals where shelter_id matches their associated shelter from the users-shelters relationship
4. WHEN a shelter admin attempts to create new shelters THEN the system SHALL prevent this action and display appropriate messaging
5. WHEN a shelter admin adds animal pictures THEN the system SHALL store them in the animalpictures table linked to the animal_id
6. IF a shelter admin is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all backend functionality properly organized in a backend folder structure, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize Supabase using environment variables from the .env file
2. WHEN backend operations are needed THEN the system SHALL use properly organized backend files in a dedicated backend folder
3. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL use the established database schema with proper relationships
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL route through properly structured backend endpoints
5. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use Supabase auth with role-based access control

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of any role, I want the application to have consistent theming and user experience, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user accesses admin or shelter pages THEN the system SHALL apply the current application theme consistently
2. WHEN forms are displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling and validation patterns
3. WHEN data is loaded THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN actions are successful THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback to users

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system user, I want proper role-based access control with database relationships, so that each user type can only perform actions appropriate to their role and data is properly linked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL use Supabase auth for authentication and create a corresponding record in the users table
2. WHEN a shelter admin is created THEN the system SHALL link them to a specific shelter in the shelters table
3. WHEN a user attempts to access admin functions THEN the system SHALL verify admin role from the users table before allowing access
4. WHEN a shelter admin attempts to access shelter functions THEN the system SHALL verify their shelter association from the database
5. WHEN role-specific actions are performed THEN the system SHALL enforce business rules and maintain proper foreign key relationships

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign up and log in using Supabase authentication, so that my account is properly created and linked to the appropriate database tables.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL use Supabase auth to create an authentication record
2. WHEN a user completes signup THEN the system SHALL automatically create a corresponding record in the users table with the same UUID
3. WHEN a shelter admin signs up THEN the system SHALL link their user record to the appropriate shelter in the shelters table
4. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate through Supabase auth and retrieve their role from the users table
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and prevent access

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Supabase integration setup, so that all database operations work seamlessly with the frontend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL create a Supabase client using the URL and anon key from environment variables
2. WHEN database queries are needed THEN the system SHALL use the initialized Supabase client
3. WHEN user data is needed THEN the system SHALL query the users table linked to auth.users via foreign key
4. WHEN shelter data is needed THEN the system SHALL query the shelters table and maintain proper relationships
5. WHEN file uploads occur THEN the system SHALL use Supabase storage for animal pictures
